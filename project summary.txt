IDEA:

Communicate over bluetooth using megacheap Arduino modules
Not sure yet which module would be best but there is an incredible range to choose from, so I'm confident we can find something good

Arduino on bot, of course -- and also a separate Arduino for each controller

We could probably power these using battery packs & rechargeable AAs or somesuch

There are lots of options for controllers. One cool option would be using PS1 DualShocks

We could push the DualShock analog stick positions over bluetooth and have those control the robot

It looks like if the number of robots on the "field" is <= 10, then we should be more or less fine as far as signal interference
(bluetooth uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-hopping_spread_spectrum to minimize jamming)
(wifi runs on the same frequency range using similar mechanisms & you can reach the lower double digits in terms of overlapping hotspots before you start to see trouble)

Here are some resources regarding interfacing the Arduino with PS1 controllers:
Arduino library:
    http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/PSXLibrary
    It looks like this library was written for the /original/ PS1 controller, which was short-lived for good reason & which lacked double joysticks.
    That's no bueno for our project. If we can't support tank style controls then we have already failed.
    Good news is, it looks like it would be easy to port the library to support DualShock controllers by using the reference data in the links below.

More data on PSX controller setup & protocol:

There are a lot more similar resources where these came from.

The big open question at this point is: How do we make the controller look & feel good?
As far as hardware we're carrying around, there's the actual DualShock, plus a battery pack, plus an Arduino and a (small) Bluetooth module.
This is a lot of stuff. Do we casemod the controller? How? Custom case? Duct tape? It's easy to come up with a working kludge, but hard to come up with an idea that's nice.



TOTAL HARDWARE REQS:

On top of the existing robot hardware, of course
* One Arduino -- to bridge btwn controller & bluetooth link
* Two Bluetooth shields or modules -- one for robot, one for controller
  It looks like a pairing of HC-06 and HC-05, respectively, would be a good option here. The price tag here comes out to about $6 apiece, so $12 total
* One PS1 DualShock controller
* One battery pack & enough rechargeables to fill it
* Whatever aesthetic case stuff we want to use to beautify the controller setup
