Shopping list!

For each controller/robot pair, we need:

* 1 Arduino Micro
        http://store.arduino.cc/product/A000053
    or, http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy

* 2 HC-05 Bluetooth Transceiver Module
        http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/310540196588?lpid=82&chn=ps
    or any of 1000 other sources

* 1 External battery pack that can power an Arduino
        Probably the best way to go is with a 9V battery
   e.g. http://www.parts-express.com/snap-type-battery-clip-with-wire-leads-for-9v-batteries-battery-holders--090-805
   or anywhere else



TO START -- probably best to get enough to make 2 or 3 robots, then get more if it all works
so, like, 2x or 3x the above part counts
